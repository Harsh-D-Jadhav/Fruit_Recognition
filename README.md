# Fruits And Vegetables Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network
This research focuses on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for fruit recognition, employing a dataset comprising 36 distinct fruit classes. The training process resulted in a model achieving an accuracy of 83.19%. The trained model was subsequently saved for deployment on various systems. In the testing phase, the model demonstrated its proficiency in recognizing images of diverse fruits and vegetables. This study presents a robust approach to fruit recognition, leveraging CNNs to enhance accuracy and efficiency in the classification of a broad spectrum of fruits within a real-world context.
